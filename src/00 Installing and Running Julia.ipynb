    "# Installing and Running Julia\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook describes the installation process for various components of the software. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Competences\n",
    "\n",
    "The reader will be able to install `Julia  1.0.x` and all its components, to run `Julia` and start `IJulia`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installing Python and Jupyter\n",
    "\n",
    "To install and use `IJulia` you need to install [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/):\n",
    "\n",
    "- follow the instructions at http://jupyter.org/install.html\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installing Julia\n",
    "\n",
    "To install Julia download and extract prebuilt binary for your operating system - see [Downloads](https://julialang.org/downloads/).\n",
    "\n",
    "After instalation, you can start Julia in terminal mode by clicking its icon (Windows) or running command `julia` (Linux).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installing and running `IJulia`\n",
    "\n",
    "Do the following:\n",
    "* start Julia\n",
    "* at the `julia` prompt type\n",
    "```\n",
    "using Pkg\n",
    "Pkg.add(\"IJulia\")\n",
    "Pkg.add(\"PyPlot\")\n",
    "using IJulia\n",
    "notebook(detached=true)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This opens IJulia window in your browser. (_The first two commands need to be executed only the first time!_). Semi-colon is the shell escape symbol, so, for example `; ls` gives directory listing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Later, you can also start `IJulia` by executing command \n",
    "```\n",
    "jupyter notebook\n",
    "```\n",
    "in the command prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Remarks\n",
    "\n",
    "In Linux, packges are installed in the directory `$HOME/.julia/packages/`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Windows (10), you will have Julia icon which starts Julia command window.\n",
    "Julia is installed in the directory (`AppData` is a hidden directory):\n",
    "```\n",
    "\\Users\\your_user_name\\AppData\\Local\\Julia-???\n",
    "```\n",
    "The packages are installed in a directory `\\Users\\your_user_name\\.julia\\packages`\n",
    "In Julia, current path and directory listing are obtained by Julia commands\n",
    "`pwd()` and `readdir()`, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prior to executing `notebook()` command, you can use shell commands in `Julia` prompt to change directory, something like \n",
    "```\n",
    "; cd ../../my_julia_directory`\n",
    "```"
